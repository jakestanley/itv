# Checkout

## Assumptions
- list // TODO
- data is provided to the application via two comma separated, row delimited files with a header row
- skus.csv would contain SKU references and their normal prices
- offers.csv would provide offers criteria and will be matched against the data provided in the SKUs file
- SKU item names will be represented with strings and their prices with integers, and they'll be stored in a HashMap<String, Integer> 
- purchases will use the "checkout" metaphor and the user // TODO
- only positive, non-zero SKU prices are accepted

## Nice-to-haves
- JSON parsing
- API 

## Approach 

I regularly use an IDE for Java development but I decided not to for this technical test. This was because I wanted to demonstrate my understanding without the assistance offered by an IDE.

## Planning

## Development

## Testing

tested on macOS Sierra, 6GB RAM, INTEL I5..., java version...

### Test cases

### Unit tests
*junit tests* - should be included

# Tools and packages used

## Java libraries // TODO add links
- lombok (Java library that provides annotations for creating getters and setters at compile time. keeps code clean) // TODO links
- JCommander for parsing arguments
- macOS Sierra
- Terminal
- Sourcetree (mainly for staging lines as it's much easier to do in a GUI)
- vim
- maven
- git
- Sublime Text 3
- brew
- zsh
- Oh My Zsh
- pandoc (for generating HTML from Markdown)
